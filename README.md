# qr-challenge

This is my very first challenge after undergoing a quick course on HTML and CSS.

My process may seem to be very basic at this point but I just wanted to gauge how much I have learned so far in the course by undertaking this challenge.

Feel free to comment and suggest better ways to solve this challenge.

Always eager to learn. Cheers!
